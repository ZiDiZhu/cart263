# Summer Time Machine Blues

## Story abstract:
A sci-fi club concocts a plan to repair a remote by using a time machine that suddenly appears.

## Adaptation notes:
This film is my favorite time-traveling comedy! The plot is compact with information, the amount of foreshadowing is insane and makes this movie very rewatchable.

The way I want to adapt this film is making an rpg-like interactive program.

So far, I made some basic features:
- dialogues (using JSON)
- clicking on an item to investigate it, and
- changing the scene when the dialogues are finished playing.

I've only included 1 complete scene so far as a 'pilot', as I intend to complete this program as my final project for the semester.

Aside from implementing the complete plot, there are some general goals on continuing the projects such as:
- animation sequences
- minigames
- saving the player's progress
- complete UI
- allowing the player to select the chapter to re-play
etc.
