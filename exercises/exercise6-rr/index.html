        On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor’s manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host’s archaeological knowledge in identifying the <span class="secret redacted">hieroglyphics on the bas-relief</span>. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology. Young <span class="secret redacted">Wilcox</span>’s rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, “It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of <span class="secret redacted">strange cities</span>; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or <span class="secret redacted">garden-girdled Babylon.”</span>
        <br><br>
        It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in <span class="secret redacted">New England</span> for some years; and<span class="secret redacted"> Wilcox</span>’s imagination had been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of <span class="secret redacted">great Cyclopean cities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths,</span> all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. <span class="secret redacted">Hieroglyphics</span> had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, <span class="secret redacted">“Cthulhu fhtagn”</span>.
